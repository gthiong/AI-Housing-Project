# AI-Housing-Project
This project is a Machine Learning Project that uses Microsoft Azure for modeling and training. We will use Boston Housing data to create and train our model. It is recommended that you have Azure account to fully implement the model. 
We will predict housing prices of a new house using linear regression. Linear regression is used to predict values of unknown input when the data has some linear relationship between input and output variables.
